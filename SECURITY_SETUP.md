# üîí Security Setup Instructions

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: API Key Configuration Required

This project has been secured by removing all exposed API keys. You must configure your own API keys to run the application.

### Setup Steps:

1. **Add your Unsplash API key to `local.properties`:**
   ```properties
   UNSPLASH_API_KEY=your_actual_unsplash_api_key_here
   ```

2. **Get your Unsplash API key:**
   - Visit [Unsplash Developers](https://unsplash.com/developers)
   - Create a new application
   - Copy your Access Key

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Reminders:

- **NEVER** commit `local.properties` to git
- **NEVER** put real API keys in source code
- **ALWAYS** use BuildConfig or environment variables for sensitive data
- **REVOKE** any exposed keys immediately

### Files That Were Secured:

- ‚úÖ `Constants.kt` - Now uses BuildConfig
- ‚úÖ `.env` - Replaced with placeholders
- ‚úÖ `local.properties` - Added to .gitignore
- ‚úÖ `.gitignore` - Updated security rules
